# VP_intern_project
Project completed solely by me in the summer of 2022 for my internship at Variant Perceptions.

I created a reverse index tagging algorithm that allows tags to be assigned to images. Images associated with each tag are then returned when queried by the user. In the original file I submitted, my algorithm returned JSON objects of each image; however, in this version, I made it return a webpage displaying the images.
